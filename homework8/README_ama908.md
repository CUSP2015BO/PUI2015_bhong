Nice stacked bar plot! I like the color! My suggetions as follow :)

1. Modify title: make bigger title.
2. Make bigger axis labels. 
3. Add total value of each disease above the stacked bar.
4. Add each yearly value (number of percentage) of each diseae in the bar to compare a size.
5. Or if possible, add guideline between yearly left bar and right bar to compare a size. 
6. Modify(decrease) width of bar.
7. Adding horizontal sub grid will make readable plot.

Good luck!
